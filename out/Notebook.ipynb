    "\n",
    "For the task at hand, the goal was to develop a PySpark pipeline capable of handling schema evolution seamlessly, with MongoDB selected as the flexible sink to accommodate schema changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The project commenced with the recognition that the source data's schema might evolve over time, necessitating a robust solution capable of adapting to these changes without disrupting downstream processes.\n",

    "To achieve the requirements of the project\n",
    "- The chosen approach leverages PySpark's capability to infer schemas dynamically, allowing for the processing of incoming data with varying structures. By setting `infer_schema` to true, the pipeline can adapt to changes in the source schema without manual intervention. \n",
    "- We can also define the transformation pipeline so that only the columns we want are selected(unecessary columns are dropped), so that additional columns from upstream sources would be filterd out\n",
    "- for the case of a type change in schema, we can handle them through the script by casting relevant columns to our expected type before transformatin begins.\n",
    " \n",
    "So, during processing, unnecessary fields are filtered out, ensuring compatibility with the existing schema. In cases where data types differ between the incoming and existing schemas, PySpark's flexible data manipulation functionalities enable seamless type casting to maintain consistency.\n"

    "To address scenarios where accommodating new fields and data types is necessary, MongoDB was selected as the sink due to its inherent flexibility and schema-less nature. \n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB's document-oriented structure allows for the storage of heterogeneous data without predefined schemas, making it an ideal choice for storing data with evolving structures. \n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging MongoDB as the sink, the PySpark pipeline can store data with new schema attributes effortlessly, ensuring continuity and scalability in data storage.\n"

By integrating MongoDB as the sink, the pipeline achieves flexibility in accommodating evolving schemas, laying the groundwork for scalable and future-proof data processing solutions."
